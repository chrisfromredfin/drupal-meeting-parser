# drupal-meeting-parser
This is a bare bones Google Chrome extension to copy Drupal Slack meeting threads to the system clipboard.

Many Drupal teams use threaded meetings to discuss current topics. This
extension helps to archive the meeting log from these meetings for posterity.
Crediting meeting participants is facilitated as well.

## How to install

1. Enable developer mode for Google Chrome Extensions. 
   See https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/faq#faq-dev-01

2. Clone this repository to any location on your local computer.

3. Use the "Load unpacked" option under Chrome Extensions to add this
   unpacked Chrome Extension to your browser. Pick the directory you checked
   this out to.

4. A grayed out Drupal meeting parser icon will appear in your browser alongside
   the URL bar.

4. Open the chatroom in Google Chrome. The icon will become blue and four
   bright yellow buttons should apear on the top of the page: Clear memory, 
   Add with credit, Add without credit and To clipboard.

## When to use

It is advised not to save the meeting log right after the meeting as the format
itself allows remote participants to join slightly later. You should save the
meeting logs a day or so later when the meeting text is still available but
everybody had a chance to chime in.

## How to use

The extension has internal storage for all your added threads. You can
clear the internal storage with 'Clear memory', add a thread to it with 
'Add with credits' or 'Add without credits' and copy the contents of that
storage (all the threads you added in the order you added them) to the
operating system's clipboard with the 'Copy to clipboard' button.

1. Open each thread in the chat sidebar you want to add to the meeting notes.
   Click one of the 'Add' buttons once the sidebar appears. Repeat this for all
   threads you want to add to the notes. The script should scroll to the top
   of the thread first to autoload all items and then scroll to the bottom
   of the thread too until it loads all items from there as well.

2. When done, click 'Copy X threads to clipboard'. Now your meeting notes are
   on the operating system clipboard and can be pasted into the Drupal meeting
   node for posterity.

3. At the end of the paste, you will find a 'Participants' section. This
   includes chat usernames of participants for threads you added 'with credit'.
   It is a best practice to credit active meeting participants on the meeting
   notes issue. You can do that by pasting the list of participants at the end
   of your drupal.org meeting issue in the 'Credit others' textfield (in the
   'Crediting & committing' fieldset). This field is only visible for maintainers
   of a project. If you are not a maintainer, ask a maintainer to credit people.

   Do keep in mind two things. First of all, it is a best practice to only
   credit active meeting participants. That is people who actually contributed
   to the meeting. You can use the 'Add without credit' button for introductory or
   off-topic threads you want to save without credits assigned. Second, drupal.org
   usernames will not always be the same as chat usernames. When you save credits
   after you pasted the list, check which users got credits and find and add the
   actual drupal.org usernames for the missing participants to credit. Then save
   them with another comment. Some common user name mappings are included with the
   script. We can add more, please submit them as issues at
   https://github.com/mdlutz24/drupal-meeting-parser/issues.

   Finally, don't forget to close the issue as fixed so the credits will be
   granted.
